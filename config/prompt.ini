[prompts]
default_prompt = Identify and list all IP addresses, domains, hostnames, usernames, and email addresses in the given text. Hostnames appear immediately after the timestamp in each log entry, usernames can be part of email addresses or appear as standalone words, domains often follow a pattern like 'example.com', and IP addresses follow the pattern of four sets of numbers separated by dots. Please format the output in a structured, readable way with clear headings and each item on a new line. Even if the text does not explicitly mention 'user', 'host', or 'domain', identify them based on their patterns.
